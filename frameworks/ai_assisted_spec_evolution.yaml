source_quote: 'Start High-Level, Let AI Elaborate

  Begin with a concise brief rather than over-engineering upfront. Use "Plan Mode"
  (read-only) to have the agent draft detailed specs from your vision, then refine
  collaboratively before execution.


  Test, Iterate, and Evolve

  Treat specs as living documents. Run continuous tests after milestones, update specs
  based on findings, and use version control. Maintain feedback loops between AI output
  and specification refinement.'
use_when: 当需要快速迭代软件规范，并希望利用AI的能力辅助生成和优化规范时。
